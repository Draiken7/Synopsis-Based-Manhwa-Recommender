# Tag Based Recommender

There are 18 unique tags provided in the [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iridazzle/webtoon-originals-datasets?select=webtoon_originals_en.csv) that can be used to generate [cosine similarity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/cosine-similarity#:~:text=Cosine%20similarity%20measures%20the%20similarity,document%20similarity%20in%20text%20analysis.) scores,
which can then be used as vectors and recommendation can be a filtered set of 5-10 closest vectors to the input.
